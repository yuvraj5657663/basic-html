                <p>Pet adoption is the process of transferring responsibility for a pet that was previously owned by
                    another party. Common
                    sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters, rescue groups, or other pet owners. Some
                    organizations give adopters
                    ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model wherein the organization retains some
                    control over the
                    animal's future use or care.To help lower the number of animals euthanized each year, some shelters
                    have developed a no-kill policy. Best Friends
                    Animal Society is the largest no-kill shelter in the United States who adopts policies such as "Save
                    Them All".[2] This
